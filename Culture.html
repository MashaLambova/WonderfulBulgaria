  <h1>What is special about the culture of Bulgaria?</h1>
  <p>
  The ancient Greeks and Romans significantly influenced the culture of Bulgaria. Until now, hundreds of historical monuments built before our era have been preserved in this country. Bulgarian folk holidays and customs date back to those distant times when people tried to appease the mysterious forces of nature with offerings. Bulgarian folklore is considered one of the richest in the Balkans. The Fire Dance is an ancient religious ritual in Bulgaria. Barefoot people dance on smouldering coals, which helps, as the Bulgarians believe, to get rid of diseases. Even from the name of this country, many people feel uplifted, and there is a desire to relax and admire the beauties to their heart’s content. And admiring them, you can enjoy the national traditions and peculiarities of this country. Let’s take a closer look at what Bulgaria is famous for? Where do roots grow from? The history and cultural heritage of Bulgaria has Slavic roots. And the Slavs, in turn, received the most significant part of their cultural heritage from the ancient peoples - the Byzantines and Thracians. Since the Middle Ages, Bulgaria has been considered the “cradle of Slavic culture”. I would like to consider the most important cultural areas in more detail.

    Local music festivals have long become one of the largest in Europe, and the timbre and range of voices of Bulgarian performers are a matter of national pride. Family traditions are especially revered in the country. Often several generations live under the same roof. Bulgarian families are always friendly and honour the elders. From the past to the present The Bulgarian national costume stands out from the background of other European countries. The inhabitants of Bulgaria began to show their colour at the beginning of the 12th century. This clothing is a harmonious combination of Slavic, European and Turkish outfits.The variety of women’s dresses and headwear is simply mesmerising. Previously, the national costume of Bulgaria was made exclusively from self-sewn fabric.

    The craftswomen showed their respectful attitude and respect for creating the national costume. An interesting fact is that women sewed only on certain days of the month. They took this process seriously. The first national attire was a sundress made of woollen yarn, which was called suk man. Its distinguishing feature was a trapezoid shape and a plunging neckline. At first, it was the same in all regions of the country, but gradually the inhabitants of each locality introduced something new and unusual into creating national attire. An essential part of the women’s national costume of Bulgaria is the headdress.
    A bright, spectacular and original attribute of a beautiful image allows you to bring in new colours, and add unusualness and originality to the bow. Often coins, beads and colourful paintings act as decor. The headdress will enable you to create a solemn bow. The highlight of the Bulgarian national dress is also the presence of the sound that it makes when walking. It is similar to a melody due to the chime of many decorations. Girls prefer to wear earrings, necklaces, necklaces, as well as fabulous headdresses, decorated with beautiful metal plates, as well as semi-precious stones. It is the combination of all decorations and decors that creates a pleasant sound.

    Bulgarian folk dances, according to their different way of performance, are grouped into six folklore areas. Each of them is distinguished by its own style and character of the dances, but sharp boundaries cannot be set, since they have mutually influenced each other. Style should be understood as the external manifestation of the movements of the human body, and character is the totality of the inner feelings and state of mind of the performers.
