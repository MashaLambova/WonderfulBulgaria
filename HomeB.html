    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-left: 30px;">About Bulgaria:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Bulgaria is an actively developing original state of South-Eastern Europe with an area of ​​110,993 km². This is the place of the eternal tourist season: here the beaches with golden sand and clear water grow into the most remarkable mountains that occupy most of the country. Bulgaria is famous for its pleasant and healthy microclimate, beautiful landscapes and low prices. Almost all resort complexes are equipped with an all-inclusive service. The capital is the city of Sofia.
      The country's population is about 7.2 million people, and Bulgarians represent the majority. This extraordinary ethnic group arose due to the assimilation of the legendary Thracians, Turkic-speaking tribes and southern Slavs during the Great Migration in the 4th-7th centuries AD. e. Distinctive features of the Bulgarian mentality are good nature, diligence, openness and hospitality, harmoniously combined with temperament, waywardness and passionate love for the Motherland. Such features in the behaviour of the Bulgarians can provide a genuinely fascinating stay in the country: residents will not only do everything for the guests' comfort. Still, they will also try to tell as much as possible about their history and culture.
      In the south, Bulgaria borders on such titans of the tourism business as Turkey and Greece, successfully adopting their experience. Thanks to natural conditions, two diametrically opposed industries are successfully developing in the country: ski resorts and beach holidays on the golden sands of the Black Sea coast. But Bulgaria is famous not only for its excellent resorts - a significant part of the economy is agriculture. Its key industries are winemaking and tobacco growing.
        Despite the deep economic crisis that lasted throughout the last decade of the 20th century, the new millennium was marked for the state by several successful reforms that led to a gradual improvement in the population's standard of living. Today’s Bulgaria is a prosperous market economy that boasts some of the lowest prices in the European Union, of which it has been a member since 2007.

        <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Climate</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">As a rule, winters in Bulgaria are pretty frosty, while summers can be warm or very hot. Spring and autumn are short, with a humid climate, although regional differences exist.
    On the <em>Black Sea coast</em>, winters are milder than in Sofia, and summer temperatures can reach Mediterranean heights. In some mountainous areas, snow can lie until early June. The Danube Plain is the driest region in the country.
    The average January temperature in Sofia ranges from -2 to -4°C, while in July, the temperature fluctuates between 16-27°C. On the Black Sea coast, the average January temperature goes from -1 to -6°С; in July, the temperature is kept in the range of 19-30°С.
    The average annual rainfall throughout Bulgaria is 630 mm. It can rain at any time of the year, but the most rainy days are in spring and early June.</p>
    
     <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Cities and resorts</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;">It is difficult to say which city in Bulgaria is the most ancient. Some of them were formed by the Greeks and Romans (eg Balchik, Sofia, Varna and Sozopol).
        At the moment, the largest Bulgarian cities are Sofia (more than 1.4 million people), Plovdiv (390 thousand people), Varna (350 thousand people), Burgos (about 220 thousand people), Rousse (more than 170 thousand people), and Stara Zagora (170 thousand people).
        The most popular beach resorts are Albena, Dunes, Golden Sands, Burgas, Kranevo, Obzor, Rusalka and Sozopol. It should be noted that more than 97% of the coast of Bulgaria meets the environmental requirements of the EU.
      Bulgaria is known for its beach and ski resorts.
      There are no less ski resorts in Bulgaria than beach resorts. Among them are Bansko, Borovets, Pamporovo, Semkovo, Kulinoto and Uzana. This means that the best Bulgarian ski resorts are located in the Rhodope, Pirin and Rila mountains.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Nature and landscape</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Bulgaria is generously endowed with natural wonders. The Black Sea beaches are among the best in Europe. The country is crossed by large mountain ranges, between which fertile valleys stretch. At a well-chosen time (at the end of April), you can go skiing one day, and the next day - sunbathing on the beach.</p>
